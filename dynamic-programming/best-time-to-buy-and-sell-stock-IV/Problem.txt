You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer k.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most k transactions: i.e. you may buy at most k times and sell at most k times.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
Example 2:

Constraints:

1 <= k <= 100
1 <= prices.length <= 1000
0 <= prices[i] <= 1000

Solve this code in java, and please provide Main.java to test the code in seperate code
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {
        
    }
}
